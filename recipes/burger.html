    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>The best burger recipe for summertime grilling! 
    This <em>juicy burger</em> is jam-packed with all kinds of stuff and has no 
    tasteless bread crumbs. Serve on buns with your favorite condiments.</p>

    <p>Tastes just like Five Guys' Cheeseburgers, one of the <strong><em>best</em></strong>
    I've ever had in my life!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1.5 lbs lean ground beef</li>
        <li>0.5 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>0.5 cup shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 oz envelope dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tbs garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tps soy sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix, minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
        <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

    </ol>
