The project is to learn and apply basic HTML skills.

I aim to practice basic Git commits, status and commands alongside building a basic website with HTML.

I credit The Odin Project for this guide and helping me learn a lot so far!

Credits to allrecipes.com for providing all these delicious recipes that I will never be able to cook!

Personal Notes: need to make better use of Git and commit often to show drastic changes and as practice
